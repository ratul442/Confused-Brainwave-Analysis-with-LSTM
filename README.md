# Confused-Brainwave-Analysis-with-LSTM

# Description

We collected EEG signal data from 10 college students while they watched MOOC video clips. We extracted online education videos that are assumed not to be confusing for college students, such as videos of the introduction of basic algebra or geometry. We also prepare videos that are expected to confuse a typical college student if a student is not familiar with the video topics like Quantum Mechanics, and Stem Cell Research. We prepared 20 videos, 10 in each category. Each video was about 2 minutes long. We chopped the two-minute clip in the middle of a topic to make the videos more confusing.
The students wore a single-channel wireless MindSet that measured activity over the frontal lobe. The MindSet measures the voltage between an electrode resting on the forehead and two electrodes (one ground and one reference) each in contact with an ear.
After each session, the student rated his/her confusion level on a scale of 1-7, where one corresponded to the least confusing and seven corresponded to the most confusing. These labels if further normalized into labels of whether the students are confused or not. This label is offered as self-labelled confusion in addition to our predefined label of confusion.
